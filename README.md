## tgBoost
tgBoost is a **pipeline** infrastructure enabling development of QSAR/QSPR models based on molecular SMILES notation. The pipeline is based on the representation of chemical species via mol2vec, a machine learning algorithm converting molecular SMILES into molecular embeddings. The pipeline comes with a pretrained **machine learning model** that predicts the glasss transition temperature (<em>T</em><sub>g</sub>) of monomer organic compounds, and developed from the largest dataset of <em>T</em><sub>g</sub> measurements. 

## Motivation
tgBoost is a kickstart project aiming at expanding the use of Machine Learning (ML), Data Engineering and Quantitative Structure‚ÄìProperty Relationships (QSPR) in Physical Chemistry.

## Requirements
* **Python >=3.6.0** (Python 2.x is [not supported](http://www.python3statement.org/))
* [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
* [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
* [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
* [gensim](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/)
* [RDKit](http://www.rdkit.org/docs/Install.html)
* [mol2vec](https://github.com/samoturk/mol2vec)
* [xgboost](https://pypi.org/project/xgboost/)

## Installation
`pip install https://github.com/U0M0Z/tgboost`

The tgBoost library needs the independent installation of rdkit via conda-forge:

`conda install -c conda-forge rdkit`

## Build status
Build status of continus integration i.e. travis, appveyor etc. Ex. -
